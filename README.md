This project was an assignment from the Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences. 
The task was to implement 3 machine learning methods that should perform classification for 3 different types of vegetables. 
The focus was primarily on feature engineering, meaning that features had to be generated from images and a dataset had to be created independently. 
Furthermore, the purpose was to gain a basic understanding of AI methods and how their underlying mathematics works. All photos for the dataset were taken independently.

Additional tasks included:
- All 3 selected methods had to be implemented from scratch in addition to their implementation
- The methods had to be compared with the corresponding algorithms from the scikit-learn library
- The features had to be generated independently
- The ML models had to classify carrots, potatoes, and onions
- An outlier detection for vegetable varieties with shoots had to be implemented
